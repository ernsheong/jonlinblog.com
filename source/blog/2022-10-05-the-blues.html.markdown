Not sure where it came from or how it came to be.

It started before the pandemic started. But the pandemic made it worse.

That feeling of just sitting there, demotivated and not feeling like doing anything. All day. I used to code a lot on the side, but I could not longer do so.

My consciousness knows something is up. Something is wrong.

I slept a lot. A lot. Napped three or four times a day. Stupidly my job was so undemanding that I could do this.

I fought. I jogged. I ran. I drove my (new) car aimlessly. I went out to the malls by myself. I bought a mirrorless camera and tried to pick it up as a hobby. I met up with some people. I went to church.

But my consciousness kept dipping. My brain was fogging more and more.

One day I realized my eyesight was dipping too. My eyesight started to have a yellow tint.  My consciousness was dipping further. It was like my field of vision was narrowing.

In my panic, I sought help. F the people who kept telling me to not use medication. Iâ€™m on pills now and it keeps my consciousness at a functional level.

Welcome to the blues. It never goes away.
