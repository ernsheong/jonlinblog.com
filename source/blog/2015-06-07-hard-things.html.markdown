Here are some hard things I want to accomplish in the next 5 years:

1. **Stay at my current job (BAE Systems AI) for at least 5 years.** My longest stint was only slightly over a year.
Perhaps things have changed, and people switch jobs every two years nowadays, but it doesn't have to be that way. I just want
to learn how to commit to a job for a longer period of time. I now see multiple short term job switches as a badge of dishonor.
1. **Use my iPhone 5s for at least 3 years.** The larger iPhone 6 screen is so tempting... But at the same time
upgrading is a sheer waste of money. Again, I want to learn commitment as well as contentment (unless the phone breaks).
1. **Get married and start a family.** This is a hard one. Some people are incredibly lucky, but for me trying to get someone I genuinely
like to like me back enough for even just a first date is so hard. Maybe it's just a matter of timing.
1. **Get deeper into learning Chinese.** I already have 2 years of Chinese during my college days. Someday I want to be able to read the Bible in Chinese, and perhaps even give a real speech in Chinese.
1. **Develop 2-3 iOS apps that generate some revenue.** Publish 2-3 high quality iOS apps that are able to generate some revenue. Doesn't
have to be too complicated or complex, but definitely apps which I would use myself.
1. **Figure out what's next in ministry.** I mean, serving in worship, young adults, etc. in my church is nice and comfy. But
staying in comfort is not really something I want to do forever. Maybe the time will come to go and do something more radical.
