## A Psalm for depression

**Psalm 23 (ESV)**

	The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
	  He makes me lie down in green pastures.
	He leads me beside still waters.
	  He restores my soul.
	He leads me in paths of righteousness
	  for his name's sake.

	Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
	  I will fear no evil,
	for you are with me;
	  your rod and your staff,
	  they comfort me.

	You prepare a table before me
	  in the presence of my enemies;
	you anoint my head with oil;
	  my cup overflows.
	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
	  all the days of my life,
	and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
	  forever.

## A Psalm for anxiety or panic attacks

**Psalm 131 (ESV)**

	O Lord, my heart is not lifted up;
	  my eyes are not raised too high;
	I do not occupy myself with things
	  too great and too marvelous for me.
	But I have calmed and quieted my soul,
	  like a weaned child with its mother;
	  like a weaned child is my soul within me.

	O Israel, hope in the Lord
	  from this time forth and forevermore.
