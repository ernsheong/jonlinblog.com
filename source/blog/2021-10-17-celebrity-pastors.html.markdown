In the aftermath of the [fall of Mars Hill church](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/podcasts/rise-and-fall-of-mars-hill/), it is a good time to explore the rise and fall of celebrity pastors, and what it actually means for the lay Christian. Because this is also happening everywhere in Malaysia.

A celebrity pastor (usually the Senior Pastor) is one who holds a lot of clout in his own church, to whom many churchgoers go to hear every Sunday because of his compelling preaching. He is not necessarily world or country famous like John Piper or Tim Keller (both of whom are celebrity pastors who have aged well). Many a churchgoer started attending said church because "he preaches so well". He may or may not actually preach the gospel.

This is a red flag for the church.

If said pastor is hogging the pulpit and preaching most of the time at the church, it is a very risky church to attend. It would be a matter of several years before the church implodes internally due to the pastor's own fall from the top. I've seen this happen again and again.

Inevitably due to human nature, pastors are also not immune from being human and therefore sinful. This is a fact that many Christians find difficult to accept. If the pastor is preaching well and people sing praises of him, it gets into his head. Even worse if he preaches week in and out, and there is no one else to actually preach to this pastor. He develops an infallible complex over time. He also becomes a prime target of the devil.

There are exceptions. Many celebrity pastors that are still going strong such as the aforementioned. In Redeemer's case, Keller isn't the only pastor preaching regularly, to be sure (and he is now retired). But the list of celebrity pastors who have fallen from grace are far longer: Mark Driscoll, Joshua Harris, Bill Hybels, to name a few renown ones. There are also Malaysian cases that I cannot name.

At the risk of oversimplication, I appreciate the church model where there is plurality of preachers or elders preaching every week. The ability to preach should be a requirement for being an elder. You should never see the same face two consecutive weeks. Too many times when the celebrity pastor has shot himself in the foot, the elders find themselves scrambling to get guest preachers because they are unable to themselves shepherd the flock in the ministry of the Word. When the ministry of the Word crumbles, so does the church.

In the end, it is a simple matter of church (business) continuity. Why do so many churches fail at this simple planning? Train up the elders or the young ones to preach! The celebrity pastor (if there is one in your church) can at least take a break and still listen to the Word preached to him, instead of being the one dishing out the Word all the time, burning out, and becoming susceptible to all kinds of traps.

Again, this is a very simplified take on the larger issue at hand surrounding celebrity pastors. Do check out the Christianity Today podcast (linked above) to listen more and try to learn something from it.
