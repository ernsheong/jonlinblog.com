Welcome! My name is Jonathan Ern Sheong Lin, and this is my personal site where I blog about life, software, and Christianity.
I live in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.

I am developing [PageDash](https://www.pagedash.com) full-time. Check it out!

Previous working experiences:

- Front-end software engineer at [BAE Systems KL](http://www.baesystems.com), where I worked on enterprise applications.
- Software consultant at [Belian Tech](http://beliantech.com), where I worked on Ruby on Rails apps. Currently a limited part-time effort.
- Mobile software engineer at [Snappymob](https://www.snappymob.com). I helped churn out the Android and BlackBerry apps for The Malaysian Insider,
as well as contributed to the development of Saved for iOS and Android, a budgeting and expenses app.
- Web software engineer at [Ocision](http://www.ocision.com), now a subsidiary of Star Media Group. Our products include [Propwall](http://www.propwall.com), [iBilik](http://www.ibilik.com), and [Carsifu](http://www.carsifu.my).

During my downtime, I enjoy jogging, swimming, badminton, playing the guitar, hanging out with friends, writing, and reading.

I am a Christian, saved by a God who unfailingly pursues me with his love and forgiveness despite my failures.
He gives me hope for a future while I struggle with the present.

I can be contacted at the concatenation of "ernsheong", "@", and "gmail.com".
You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/jonlinernsheong) and [@ernsheong](https://twitter.com/ernsheong).
