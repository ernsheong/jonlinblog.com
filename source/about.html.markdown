Welcome! My name is Jonathan Ern Sheong Lin, and this is my personal site where I blog about life, software, and Christianity.
I live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Petaling Jaya, to be exact).

I am a University of California, Berkeley alum with degrees in [EECS](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/) and Physics.
Currently a software engineer at [Snappymob](http://www.snappymob.com), I have worked on iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and Ruby on Rails apps.

During my downtime, I enjoy jogging, swimming, badminton, playing the guitar, hanging out with friends, writing, and reading.

I am a Christian, having been saved by a God who unfailingly pursues me with his love and forgiveness.
He gives me hope for a future while I struggle with the present.

I can be contacted at the concatenation of "ernsheong", "@", and "gmail.com".
