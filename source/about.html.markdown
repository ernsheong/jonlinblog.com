Welcome! My name is Jonathan Ern Sheong Lin, and this is my personal site where I blog about life, software, and maybe Christianity.
I live in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.

I am working a day job, but my real focus is on building products for myself and the world at [Belian Tech](https://beliantech.com). Check out [PageDash](https://www.pagedash.com), Your Digital Web Scrapbook and [The Malaysian Pulse](https://themalaysianpulse.com), Beat of the Nation.

Previous working experiences:

- Front-end Software Engineer at [BAE Systems KL](http://www.baesystems.com), where I worked on enterprise applications.
- Software Consultant at [Belian Tech](http://beliantech.com), where I worked on Ruby on Rails apps.
- Mobile Software Engineer at [Snappymob](https://www.snappymob.com). I helped churn out the Android and BlackBerry apps for The Malaysian Insider,
as well as contributed to the development of Saved for iOS and Android, a budgeting and expenses app.
- Software Engineer No. 1 at [Ocision](http://www.ocision.com), now a subsidiary of Star Media Group. Our products include [Propwall](http://www.propwall.com), [iBilik](http://www.ibilik.com), and [Carsifu](http://www.carsifu.my).

During my downtime, I enjoy jogging, swimming, badminton, playing the guitar, hanging out with friends, writing, and reading.

I am a Christian, saved by a God who unfailingly pursues me with his love and forgiveness despite my failures.
He gives me hope for a future while I struggle with the present.

I can be contacted at the concatenation of "ernsheong", the AT character, and "gmail.com".
