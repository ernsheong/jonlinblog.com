Welcome! My name is Jonathan Ern Sheong Lin, and this is my personal site where I blog about life, technology, and maybe (rant about) Christianity. I live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Professionally, I am a Cloud Architect at AIA. My (personal) technical blog can be found at [JonCloudGeek](https://joncloudgeek.com). My software business and side projects can be found at [Belian Tech](https://beliantech.com).

During my downtime, I enjoy jogging, swimming, badminton, playing the guitar, hanging out with friends, writing, and reading.

I am a Christian, saved by a God who unfailingly pursues me with his love and forgiveness despite my failures. He gives me hope for a future while I struggle with the present.

I can be contacted at the concatenation of "ernsheong", the AT character, and "gmail.com".
You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/ernsheong) and [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/jonlinernsheong).
